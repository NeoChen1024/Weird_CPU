# Weird CPU (WIP)

This is a simple proof of concept CPU made solely by myself.
There might be still some bugs floating around.

## Overview:

* 8bit Data Bus
* 16bit Data Address Bus
* 8bit I/O Address Bus
* 1 General Purpose, 1 Special Purpose Register
* Conditional / Unconditional Jump
* Indirect Addressing
* Zero Page Addressing
* 4 function ALU
* Memory-Mapped I/O (Separate Address)

## Todo:

1. Emulator in C (WIP)
2. Assembler (WIP too)

# How does it looks like?
